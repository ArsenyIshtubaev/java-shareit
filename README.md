### **_<h1 align="center">SERVICE FOR SHARING THINGS</h1>_**

---

**_Imagine that you bought some paintings at the Sunday fair and want to hang them at home.
But here's the problem - for this you need a drill, but you don't have it.
You can, of course, go to the store and buy, but there is little point in such a purchase - 
after you hang the pictures, the drill will simply gather dust in the closet. 
How much more convenient it would be if there was a service at hand where users share things!_**
